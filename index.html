<h1> Visualizations Analysis </h1>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.espn.com/"> ESPN Site </a> </l1>
<p>
  The two online visualizations I chose for my analysis of a great visualization and a poor one, are ESPN and blank respectively.
  First, beginning with ESPN, I chose this as my great visualization pick for its use of numerous elements such as graphs, charts,
  lists, and a unique CSS stlye.
